## Getting Started

Clone project
```
git clone https://github.com/KubaTaba1uga/c_lists.git
```

Currently supported lists:
 - [Array List](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_array)

Variables to define:
 - ARL_VALUE_TYPE macro standing for type that You would like to use with arl_list.c

To confirm that everything is working we can go to `examples/create_custom_types_gcc` and compile the example.
```
gcc main.c ../../src/arl_list.c  -I../../include -o main -DARL_VALUE_TYPE=char && \
./main
```

## Prerequisites
- [Meson](https://mesonbuild.com/)
- [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/)

Install perequesites by scripts
```
./scripts/install_ruby.sh
./scripts/install_meson.sh
```
If installing perequesites by scripts has failed, You need to install them manually.

## Building

Main tool used for building here is Meson. <br>
However each list is composed of one src file and one header file, which should make 
 the lib easy to compile with any other tool.

There are three building options available:
 - `enable_tests` flag indicating tests compilation
 - `arl_prefix` prefix for [array list's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_array) public interface
 - `arl_type` type of [array list's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_array) elements

Create build with some options configured
```
meson setup build -Denable_tests=false -Darl_prefix=my_prefix -Darl_type=float
```

Compile build
```
meson compile -C build
```

Src file and header file shoudl appear in build dir `build/my_prefix_list.c` `build/my_prefix_list.h`. <br>
These files are ready to include into Your project. Meson is capable of generating shared library, static
library and more. Check it out if You need more than just src files.

## Tests

Create build with tests enabled
```
meson setup build -Denable_tests=true
```

Run all tests
```
meson test -C build
```

## Generating Sources

Sources for particullar list can be generated to make things easier.

```
python3 scripts/generate_sources.py <source file> <new prefix> <new type> (<dest dir>)
```
 - `source file` is path to the particullar list, ex. `src/arl_list.c`.
 - `new prefix` is prefix which will be used in new src, ex. `arl`.
 - `new type` is type of list's elements, ex. `void *`,
 - `dest dir` is path to directory in which sources will appear, ex. `.`. This is optional argument. 

## Why
Library can be used as any other C data structure library, by compiling with default settings.
```
gcc -c src/arl_list.c -I include/ -o arl_list_lib.o
```

This is basic scenario where list's genericness is done by treating it's elements as of `void *` type. 

As this may be fine for most use cases, this kind of implementation is creating unnecessery limits. <br>
Let's imagine that You would like to use a list for `char` type, to create kind of dynamic string. <br>
It would require allocating memory for each of the chars before appending the char as an element
```
  // Dynamic string
  char *my_string_0 = "nanananananana";
  char *my_sting_1 = "RTRTRTRTRTRTR";
  char *c;
  arl_ptr l;
  size_t i;

  // Creates list's instance
  arl_create(&l, 10);

  for (i = 0; i < strlen(my_string_0); i++) {
    c = malloc(sizeof(c));
    *c = my_string_0[i];
    // Appends my_string_0's values
    arl_append(l, c);
  }
  for (i = 0; i < strlen(my_string_1); i++) {
    c = malloc(sizeof(c));
    *c = my_string_0[i];
    // Appends my_string_1's values
    arl_append(l, c);
  }
  ...
```
pretty painfull ain't it?

So why can't we use the same mechanism as for `void *` but for `char`? 

We can easilly imagine the same list but working on `char` type and this is exactly what this library is about.
You can create the same list that You are usually using (with `void *` type) but with any type that You need. 
```
gcc -c src/arl_list.c -I include/ -o arl_list_lib.o -DARL_VALUE_TYPE=char
```
```
  // Dynamic string
  char *my_string_0 = "nanananananana";
  char *my_sting_1 = "RTRTRTRTRTRTR";
  char c;
  arl_ptr l;
  size_t i;

  arl_create(&l, 10);

  for (i = 0; i < strlen(my_string_0); i++) {
    arl_append(l, my_string_0[i]);
  }
  for (i = 0; i < strlen(my_string_1); i++) {
     arl_append(l, my_string_1[i]);
  }
  ...
```

## BTW What is nice about C Lists Library?
 - Only two files are required to use particullar list, source file and header file. <br>
 - There is no macro overusage so the library is simple to understand and use. <br>
 - Library can be generated for basic types (`char`, `float`, `int` etc.) and for `void *`. <br> 
There are plans to allow custom structures and enums, if that's sth that You need, let me know ;) 
 - There is a mechanism to delete almost all macro, look on [Generating Sources](#Generating-Sources) section.
 - There is mechanism to delete names duplications, look on [Generating Sources](#Generating-Sources) section.
 - Meson support.
 - Only lists, no unnecessary stuff.
