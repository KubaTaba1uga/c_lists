# C Lists Library

Simple and leightwight library for lists datastructures, no dependencies, C99 compliant, cross platform (Windows/Linux/MacOs).

Library instance can be generated for basic types (char, float, int etc.) and for `void *`.

User can generate version of each list's seperatlly, based on defined macro.
User can use it's own structs/enums. How give capability to include user's file in project's so? Can it be done only during linking? 
Can we use sth lie opaque pointer? but without pointer?
Ideal scenario would be sth like this:
```
compile array list -DCLL_VALUE_TYPE=mytype -I../my_proj
```

Template for new c projects. Includes build system, test, mocking, readme, license, pipelines.

## Design decision
Each list's interface follows FIRST-CLASS ADT Pattern. 


## Getting Started

Clone project
```
git clone https://github.com/KubaTaba1uga/c_project_template.git <new project name>
```

Delete template git files
```
rm -rf <new project name>/.git
```

Initiate new git files
```
cd <new project name>
git init
```

Once you have initialized the repository, create a remote repository somewhere like GitHub.com.

Add the remote URL to your local git repository
```
git remote add origin <URL>
```

Commit at least one file

Push changes
```
git push -u origin master
```

I recommend installing perequesitest and confirming that all tests are passing before src/* and test/* are actually deleted.

## Prerequisites
- [Meson](https://mesonbuild.com/)
- [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/)

Ruby is used by CMock.

## Building


Install perequesites by scripts
```
./scripts/install_ruby.sh
./scripts/install_meson.sh
```

If installing perequesites by scripts has failed, You need to install them manually.


Configure build for app and tests
```
meson setup build
```

Compile build config
```
meson compile -C build
```

## Tests

Run all tests
```
meson test -C build
```

### Style test

New tests units should be grouped by directories.
To understand more look on ./test directory.

Hierarchial build is very favoured by Meson, splitting test unit's into seperate directories allow keeping meson.builds short and simple.

## Pipelines

Two pipelines are configured. <br>
unit-tests.yaml makes sure that all unit tests passed. <br>
merge-gatekeeper.yaml makes sure that all pipelines ran successfully before merging pull request.
